## What is the project ?

SolarToken aims to revolutionize the way the African diaspora makes purchases by utilizing the power of decentralized finance (Defi) on the blockchain. By leveraging crowd-sourced buying power, we aim to provide discounts from multiple vendors. By utilizing the Celo blockchain, we can take advantage of its low gas fees, mobile friendly smart contract backed payments, and offer a cost-effective solution compared to traditional methods.

## Project Description: 

SolarToken aims to revolutionize the way the African diaspora makes purchases by utilizing the power of decentralized finance (Defi) on the blockchain. By leveraging crowd-sourced buying power, we aim to provide discounts from multiple vendors. By utilizing the Celo blockchain, we can take advantage of its low gas fees and offer a cost-effective solution compared to traditional methods. The cost savings from low gas fees will be redirected to families who may not have the means to purchase goods on their own. The Defi platform will be used to aggregate vendors and compound profits to provide financial support. This project will enable cross-border transactions, further breaking down barriers and providing access to a wider range of goods and services.



The challenges addressed by the project include the high barriers to entry for solar investing and a lack of technology that simplifies the investment process. The project aims to improve solar access and reduce these barriers by transferring real value to the digital world through the use of blockchain technology and solar tokenization.

The value of the approach is to create a more transparent and secure financial system for solar investment. The solar token will help create a new economic paradigm centered around leveraging Web3 tools to solve global solar systemic problems and empower communities to preserve their natural resources. The platform will simplify the solar investment process for everyone, providing solar investment opportunities and easy investor onboarding for solar projects.

The intended users of the platform are the African diaspora and anyone looking to invest in solar energy. The goal is to make solar energy more accessible and sustainable, and to provide funding for families who cannot afford solar panels. The project is being executed by a globally diverse group of Americans with a vast network of support and experiences in government, technology, and advocacy, who come from the communities they seek to serve with this platform.

## Summary

#### basic functionality of your project:

Our project aims to provide a cost-effective solution for the African diaspora by leveraging crowd-sourced buying power to get discounts from various vendors. We plan to implement this solution using the decentralized finance (Defi) platform on Celo, which offers low gas fees, making it more cost-efficient compared to traditional solutions. The difference in cost savings due to lower gas fees will be redirected to families who cannot afford to make the purchases themselves. Currently, we have not implemented any features but are looking forward to utilizing the Defi platform and its features to aggregate vendors and compound profits to provide financial assistance to families.

Here are some features that we may implement:

Vendor Aggregation: A feature that allows users to browse and compare different vendors offering solar panels and related products, in order to secure the best deals.
Defi Compounding: Utilizing DeFi technology to compound the profit generated from the platform, which can then be distributed to families who can afford solar panels.
Low Gas Fees: As the platform will be built on the Celo network, users will benefit from low gas fees compared to traditional networks.
Crowdfunding: Utilizing the platform's profit to raise funds for families who may not be able to afford solar panels, thereby helping to bridge the gap between those who have access to clean energy and those who do not.
Community Engagement: Encouraging community engagement and collaboration through features such as user forums, feedback mechanisms, and regular updates.
Ease of Use: A user-friendly interface that makes it easy for users to navigate the platform and access information, services, and features.
Integration with other platforms: An integration with other platforms such as wallet, banking, and other financial services to streamline the process of accessing and using the platform.
